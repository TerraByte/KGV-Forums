# KGV-Forums
The KGV Student Forums were designed and programmed by Lilian Luong for King George V School, Hong Kong.
The aim was to promote student collaboration in academic education and create a relaxed, friendly and helpful environment for the offering and receiving of academic assistance to or from fellow peers.
